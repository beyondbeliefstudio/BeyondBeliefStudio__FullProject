    "question": "What happens after the 12 months?",
    "answer": "You keep your site live and fully supported as long as your plan is active. After 12 months, you can continue month-to-month or renew for another year — no pressure either way. And if you ever want to move the site elsewhere, we’ll happily send you the full code and content. At that point, the site is 100% yours.",

    "question": "Is this built with WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace?",
    "answer": "No. All sites are hand-coded from the ground up, built for speed, SEO, and flexibility. That means no bloated templates, no builder limitations, and way better performance across the board.",

    "question": "Can I make edits myself later?",
    "answer": "You won’t need to. Unlimited content updates are included in your plan — just send an email and we’ll take care of it, fast. Focus on your business. We’ve got the site covered.",

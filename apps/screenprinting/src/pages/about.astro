<Layout title="About Us">

<InternalHero title="About Us" subtitle="We're a small team doing big things for other small teams — schools, churches, businesses, breweries, artists, fundraisers, and anyone who wants to wear their message with pride." ariaLabel="Hero About-Us" />

<SplitOverlay title="Your New Favorite Print Shop" imgSrc={rewindPress} imgAlt="Photo of Press" orientation="">
    <p>What began as a weekend side project in a garage has grown into a full‑on print studio serving Monroe, NC and customers nationwide. Beyond Belief Studio delivers sharp screen prints with fast turnarounds, fair pricing, and a friendly, personal touch.</p>
    <p>We keep every job under our own roof and never cut corners. Each order gets the same care and attention, whether it’s a hundred tees for a local school or a limited drop for your brand.</p>

<SplitOverlay title="Our Story" imgSrc={basement} imgAlt="Photo of Press" orientation="left" background="bg-white">
    <p>Beyond Belief began in 2016 as a basement hobby in New Jersey where family, faith, and a single DIY press shaped every shirt. The side project soon grew into a screen printing and design studio driven by a love for community and quality. </p>
    <p>In 2023 we relocated to Monroe, NC and quickly became the go‑to “merch guys” for local schools, churches, small businesses, and non‑profits. From Chris’s first homemade screens to the pro setup we run today, our mission stays the same: make gear people are proud to wear and keep the process friendly and reliable.</p>

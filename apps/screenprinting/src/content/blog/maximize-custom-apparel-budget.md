# How to Maximize Your Budget on Custom Apparel Without Sacrificing Quality

Getting high-quality custom shirts doesn’t mean you have to blow your entire budget.  
Whether you're outfitting your team, dropping new merch, or hosting a one-time event, we’ve got tips to help you make the most of your money—without ending up with stiff, scratchy throwaways.

## 1. Choose the Right Garment for Your Audience

You don’t need the fanciest blank on the market—just the right one for the job.

- **For giveaways or one-time events:** Stick with cost-effective options like Gildan Softstyle or Port & Company.
- **For retail or brand drops:** Go with fashion-forward brands like AS Colour, Bella+Canvas, or Comfort Colors.

> 🔍 Pro Tip: If your audience _wears_ your merch more than once, you’ve already increased your ROI.

## 2. Keep Your Design Simple (And Print-Friendly)

Every color in your design adds to the cost—because it means another screen, more setup, and more labor.

- **Stick to 1-2 colors** when possible.
- **Avoid photo-realistic art** unless you're planning on DTF or sublimation.

Big impact doesn’t require a rainbow of inks. Minimalist designs often look cleaner _and_ cost less.

## 3. Limit Print Locations

Front + back + sleeve + inside tag? Looks great—but it adds up fast.

Ask yourself: _Does this extra print location actually add value?_  
If not, keep it simple and save some serious cash.

---

## 4. Hit the Price Breakpoints

The more you order, the less you pay per piece.  
For example:

- 24–47 shirts: higher per-shirt price
- 48–71 shirts: solid discount
- 72+ shirts: the real sweet spot

If you're hovering near a breakpoint, bump your quantity up—you'll usually save more in the long run.

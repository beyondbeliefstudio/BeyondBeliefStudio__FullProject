# A Deep Dive Into Screen Printing Inks: Plastisol vs. Water-Based vs. Specialty Inks

Not all inks are created equal. Whether you're going for soft, bold, eco-friendly, or textured, the ink you choose makes a major impact on the final product.

## ðŸ§´ Plastisol Ink

This is the workhorse of the industryâ€”and for good reason.

- **Bold, vibrant colors** that sit on top of the fabric
- **Super durable** and doesnâ€™t fade after washes
- Great for **all types of fabric**

It has a slightly thicker feel (a "hand" in print speak), but itâ€™s the standard for bold, crisp designs.

## ðŸŒ± Water-Based Ink

Want that vintage, soft-to-the-touch feel? This is your ink.

- **Soaks into the fibers** of the shirt rather than sitting on top
- Super soft, often **feels like itâ€™s not even there**
- More eco-friendly, but can be picky with garment types

Perfect for tonal looks or retro-styled prints.

## âœ¨ Specialty Inks

This is where things get fun.

- **Puff Ink** â€“ expands when cured for a raised texture
- **Metallics** â€“ golds, silvers, and other shiny goodness
- **Glow-in-the-dark** â€“ self-explanatory and awesome

These effects cost more, but they bring a totally different vibe to your merch.

# Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Submitting Artwork for Screen Printing

Before you hit send on that “final” logo file — pump the brakes.  
Clean artwork = clean prints. Messy files = delays, fees, and your design ending up looking like a blurry crime scene.

Let’s save us both the headache and go over the top 5 mistakes we see (and how to avoid them like a pro).

---

## 1. 🧼 **Sending Low-Resolution Files**

JPEG pulled from your Facebook profile? Hard pass.  
We need **high-resolution (300 DPI)** or — even better — **vector files** (.AI, .EPS, or .SVG).  
The higher the quality of your file, the sharper your print will be. Don’t start your order with a potato-quality image.

---

## 2. 🎨 **Not Converting Colors to Spot Colors or Pantones**

If your file says “red” but we don’t know _which_ red… you’re leaving your brand to guesswork.  
We use Pantone Solid Coated colors to keep your print consistent. Help us help you — include the exact Pantone if you know it.

---

## 3. 🖍️ **Too Many Tiny Details**

Super thin lines and microscopic text might look cool on screen — but we’re printing on fabric, not glass.  
If you need a microscope to read it, we’ll need a miracle to print it.

---

## 4. 🌀 **Not Outlining Your Fonts**

Sending a design with live fonts? Great... until we open it and every letter turns into Comic Sans because we don’t have your custom typeface.  
**Always outline your text** or send us the font files if you want to live on the edge.

---

## 5. 🧩 **Ignoring File Format Guidelines**

Screenshots. Word docs. PowerPoint files. We’ve seen it all.  
Please don’t.  
Send us **AI, EPS, SVG, or high-res PNG/PDF files**. If you’re unsure, just ask — we’ll point you in the right direction.

---

## Bonus Tip: **Talk to Your Printer First**

A quick convo with us can save you hours of revisions.  
Not sure if your file’s print-ready? Shoot it over — we’ll let you know what needs tweaking before it hits the press.

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

Great prints start with great files.  
If your artwork’s clean, we can focus on what we do best — making you look good.

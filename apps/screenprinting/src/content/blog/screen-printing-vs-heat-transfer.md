## Introduction

Let’s settle this once and for all.  
Screen printing and heat transfer are _not_ the same thing. They might both involve putting ink on a shirt, but the process, quality, and final product? Totally different ball game.

Whether you're a business owner trying to look legit, a band gearing up for a merch drop, or just someone tired of shirts that crack after one wash — this post is for you.

## What Is Screen Printing?

Screen printing is the _OG_ of custom apparel. It’s a process that involves pushing ink through a mesh screen (we literally burn your design into it) and layering that ink directly onto the garment. One color at a time. Old school. Hands-on. Built to last.

### Why People Love It:

- **Durability** – This stuff holds up. Your design won’t ghost you after a couple washes.
- **Vibrancy** – Bold, crisp prints that pop off the shirt.
- **Perfect for bulk orders** – Once the screens are set up, we’re flying through production.

### When It’s the Right Fit:

- You're ordering **24+ pieces** (that’s our shop minimum for a reason).
- You want a **high-quality**, retail-ready finish.
- Your design uses **solid colors or bold artwork**.

## What Is Heat Transfer?

Heat transfer is kind of like using a giant iron and a fancy sticker. Your design is printed on special paper or vinyl, then heat-pressed onto the garment. It’s quick, low-effort, and best used in small quantities or one-off situations.

### Why People _Think_ They Love It:

- **Low minimums** – Great if you only need a few items.
- **Easy for full-color prints** – Like photos or detailed gradients.
- **Faster setup** – No screens, no problem (but also... no soul).

### But Here's the Downside:

- **Not as durable** – Cracking, peeling, fading... especially if you wash it like a normal human.
- **Doesn’t breathe well** – That heat transfer patch on your chest? Yeah, it might double as a sweat magnet.
- **Cheaper feel** – It looks okay... until you hold it next to a properly screen-printed tee.

## So... Which One Should _You_ Choose?

Look, we’re biased — but for good reason.  
At **Beyond Belief Studio**, screen printing is our bread and butter. It’s what we do, and we do it damn well. If you’re serious about quality, consistency, and turning heads when someone sees your shirt, screen printing is the move.

But hey, if you just need a couple tees for Grandma’s birthday or a “one-night-only” bachelor party look, heat transfer might work for you (just don’t blame us if it doesn’t make it past the honeymoon).

## TL;DR

Screen printing = craftsmanship, quality, and durability.  
Heat transfer = convenience, but it might ghost you.

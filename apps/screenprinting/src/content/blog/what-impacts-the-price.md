# What Impacts the Price of a Screen Printed Order?

Let’s talk money.  
Screen printing pricing isn’t random — it’s a combo of math, materials, and a whole lot of ink. If you’ve ever wondered why one shirt costs $8 and another is $18, this post is for you.

## 🎯 The Main Factors That Affect Your Price

### 1. **Garment Type & Quality**

A plain tee and a premium heavyweight hoodie aren’t in the same league — or price bracket. The quality, brand, fabric, and even color of the garment all affect cost.  
_Spoiler: Black shirts cost more than white ones. We don’t make the rules — dye houses do._

---

### 2. **Total Quantity Ordered**

Here’s the golden rule: **The more you order, the less you pay per piece.**  
Screen printing has setup costs, so printing 12 shirts costs almost the same to set up as printing 100. Want a better price? Go big.

---

### 3. **Number of Print Colors**

Each color in your design requires a separate screen, more setup time, and more ink.  
A 1-color front print = clean and affordable.  
A 6-color front + 5-color back = you better _really_ love that design.

---

### 4. **Print Locations**

Front only? Great.  
Front + back + sleeves + inside tag? Now we’re getting spicy — and pricier.  
Each location means more setup, more printing time, and more steps.

### 5. **Artwork Prep**

If your file is clean, vectorized, and ready to roll, we love you.  
If we have to rebuild your blurry Instagram screenshot, that’s time (and cost) on our end.  
_Pro tip: Send us a proper file and we’ll all sleep better._

# Custom Printing for Events: How to Design the Right Shirt for Your Group, Fundraiser, or Festival

The best event shirts don’t just mark the moment—they become the souvenir everyone keeps.  
Here’s how to design a shirt people will actually want to wear again (and again).

---

## 1. Know Your Audience

Corporate outing? Go clean and classic.  
Music festival or charity run? Make it bold and fun.

---

## 2. Keep the Design Simple

Too much detail can get lost in translation.  
Stick to clean lines, bold text, and high-contrast layouts.

---

## 3. Choose the Right Color Shirt

Pro tip: Avoid white unless you're doing something intentional.  
Charcoal, navy, and muted earth tones always win in wearability.

---

## 4. Include the Date or Year

Give it some “limited edition” energy.  
A small “2025” on the sleeve or back print makes it feel special.

---

## 5. Make It Memorable

People don’t remember generic. Use inside jokes, clever slogans, or custom illustrations to give your shirt some soul.
